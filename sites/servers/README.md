## FAQ about all servers in general

### How to keep a program running even when I disconnect the remote terminal?
Read [this](https://www.maketecheasier.com/nohup-and-uses/).

### How can I install python packages?

You can do it using **conda** with any account. Create your own conda environment to be safe. You do not need anyone's permission to install a python package inside your conda environment. [This](https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda/en/4.6.0/_downloads/52a95608c49671267e40c689e0bc00ca/conda-cheatsheet.pdf) is a good quick start guide for conda.
<!-- 2. **docker** with docker enabled accounts. -->

In your first attempt to use conda, run the following command.

```
conda init bash
```
You might have to run the following command on every login (unless .bashrc is run automatically)
```
source ~/.bashrc
```

### How can I change the gcc or g++ version?

Method 1: Please contact the [admin](https://cepdnaclk.github.io/sites/servers/admin/) and request them run **update-alternatives** as documented [here](https://github.com/cepdnaclk/server-documentation-public).

Method 2: All gcc/g++ versions are installed in **/usr/bin/**.
Following is an example on how you can use gcc-8 as gcc using a simple trick (without sudo).
```
gcc -v#You will see what the current gcc version is
mkdir ~/symlinks
cd ~/symlinks
ln -s /usr/bin/gcc-8 ./gcc #We are creating a symbolic link called gcc to gcc-8
export PATH="~/symlinks:$PATH" #We add the new gcc to the path (before the existing path)
cd ~
gcc -v #Now you get the gcc-8 when you run gcc command 
```


### Which server is more suitable for my work?

If you are working on a heavy CPU bound computation, use [aiken](./aiken/). [Kepler](./kepler/) would be suitable if you are working on deep learning because of better GPUs and ready made datasets on the server.

### How can I conviniently run experiments on the server and remotely monitor them?

Suggested solution: [Labml](https://github.com/lab-ml/labml) is an all in one solution for conducting, logging and monitoring NN based experiments on mobile/remote PC.
